# Polynomial Homotopy GIF

## To Run/View

* clone
* build
* run

## Purpose

* Given two polynomials f and g, create a GIF illustrating the coefficient-wise straight-line homotopy h: f ~ g between them. 

## Features To Build

	* Selectively render all three or just h. 
	* For each time t in [0,1] display:
		* t
		* a slider with t moving between 0 and 1 
		* the formula for h_t.
	* Set frame count, screen size, etc.
	* Set play options: 
		* start to finish, pause before and after
		* bounce back and fourth
